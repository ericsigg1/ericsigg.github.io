For my mechatronics class, I developed a robot capable of percieving its environment with a LIDAR scanner, and then acting to manipulate objects in the environment. The challenge included identifying several objects within a constrained area, and moving them to various locations. In a team of three, I developed the hardware, electronics, and software for the robot. My main focus for this project was the software and the tuning of PID controllers, that took input from the robot's wheel encoders and gyro sensor, to effectively use its mecanum wheels to drive in any direction.
