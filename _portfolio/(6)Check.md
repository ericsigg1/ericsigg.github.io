As part of my integrated computer aided design, manufacturing, and analysis class, we completed a project in teams of four to make a chess set. We used a CNC lathe to make organic, axially symmetric pieces. The theme for our chess set was time, so each piece had some representation of a clock. The pawns were an hourglass, the bishops were clock hands, the knights were sundials, and so on. Each of these pieces was designed by our team, and we created toolpathsto produce these parts in mastercam. We also manufactured the board, which we used a waterjet cutter to complete.
