This was my final project for my integrated computer aided design, manufacturing, and analysis class. In groups of five, we were asked to develop a device using all of the skills we had acquired throughout the semester, under the theme of biomimicry. We developed this owl which used its wings as a fan, applying many of those skills. My major contributions to this project were the machining of the gears and belt pulleys which transmitted power from the motor to the wings, along with the stamping dies ued to create the feathers that were present along the back of the owl. Throughout this project I learned about stamping, and the process of creating an effective stamping die, along with four axis machining.
