As part of my work for the UPenn modular robotics lab, I developed a Robot Operating System (ROS) control system for a membrane-based soft robot, along with a structure to support the camera and robot structure itself. The control system was able to track the robot's position in real time using a camera and a custom computer vision algorithm. This data, along with the control signals sent to the robot were then stored in ROSbag file, (a common robot operating system data storage type) for easy analysis.
