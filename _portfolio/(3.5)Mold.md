During my integrated computer aided design, manufacturing, and analysis class, I developed an injection mold for a functioning rubiks cube. I conducted flow simulations to ensure the mold would fill fully, along with sink analysis to ensure the parts would form correctly, and draft analysis to ensure parts would demold easily. 

This mold was machined using three-axis machining techniques, and then used to mold these functioning rubik's cubes.
