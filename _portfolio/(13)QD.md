UUsing cadmium selenide, I manufactured quantum dots of various sizes as part of my nanofabrication and nanocharacterization course. The quantum dots were made at various sizes, dictating their emissions spectra. I manufactured quantum dots of sizes that enabled them to emit wavelengths of blue through red light, as I observed when placing them under UV light (image above). I them observed the quantum dots under a transmission electron microscope to confirm their size, which was approximatley 2.5 nanometers.
