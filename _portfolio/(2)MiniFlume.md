I spent the a portion of the summer of 2022 developing this custom system capable of creating conditions similar to those found on the continental slope in the ocean. This flume tank simulates an underwater sediment avalanche by (1) making a sediment pile of an adjustable volume fraction in its fluidization chamber, (2) Opening the gate to the fluidization chamber almost instantenously, and (3) allowing the sediment to fail into a long channel, while observing its behavior.
