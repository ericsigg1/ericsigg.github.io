I worked on the design and manufacturing of a robot leg for the NASA funded LASSIE project. The single leg that I manufactured, would be attached to a larger, four legged robot, used for exploration on other planets. This leg is used to observe how a single leg reacts to penetrating various ground materials. Experiments conducted by other researchers in my reserach group have found that by observing the forces that the leg experiences as it interacts with a granular surface, it is possible to get an idea of the rheology and material properties that a legged robot is walking on with every step that it takes, providing much higher density of information about the surface of an unknown planet than ever before.
