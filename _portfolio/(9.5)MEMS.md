This project, part of my nanofabrication and nanocharacterization class, involved the fabrication and testing of microscale MEMS comb drive devices. These devices, similar in structure to mems accelerometers or gyrocsopes commonly used in deviced today, were manufactured to be freestanding pieces of silicon that could be actuated by applying a voltage across the two sides of the comb. I manufactured several of these comb drives at various comb tooth sizes and spacing and observed thier performance.
