Using directed self assembly of block copolymers along channels created through electron beam lithography, I was able to create a set of nanopatterns on the order of 20 nanometers as part of my nanofabrication and nanocharacterization course. I then examined the patterns using electron microsocopy and atomic force microsocopy, which gave a good idea of the structure of the nanopatterns.
