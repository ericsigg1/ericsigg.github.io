As part of the Performing Arts Council Tech group, I work on stage lighting design for a wide variety of performing arts shows at UPenn. I have designed lighting for  productions including Dance, Theater, Acapella, and Musicals. Performers will often have an idea of what they would like the show to look like, but often also give me some creative liberty to bring the show to life with the equipment available in the space they are performing in.
