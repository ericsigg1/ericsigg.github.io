In my nanofabrication and nanocharacterization class, I manufactured a set of transistors on a chip using 2d material technology. Using graphene as the semiconductor in the transistor and a silicon gate, I was able to make twenty working transistors on a chip, several of them with an observable dirac point near zero volts. A dirac point near zero volts indicates that the transitor functions well. I experimented in also using these transistors in a microfluidic device as a pH sensor, which was also successful.
