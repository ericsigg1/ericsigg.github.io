I spent the summer of 2023 developing these small, 4 inch long boats for the Scalable Autonomous Robots Lab, and was advised by Dr. Ani Hsieh. They are equipped with wireless communication technology and are used in conjunction with an optitrak motion capture system. This allows them to be tested in a small pool where we can create various currents, and allow the robots to collaboratively discover their environment. Our lab has now shared our boat designs with others that also wish to do similar group robotic experiments

I collaborated with a masters student to design these boats from the ground up. I developed custom boat hulls, and tested configurations of motors and motor controllers to find the most cost effective and reliable solution. From my first prototype in a plastic tub, to the finished product I learned alot about design, electronics, and software, in particular the integration of these three.

I also spent countless hours testing and tuning PID controllers to get these boats to travel as we hoped. These graphs show the final results of testing.
