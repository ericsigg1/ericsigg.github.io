As part of my integrated computer aided design, manufacturing, and analysis class, I completed this solid metal Space Shuttle model. Using Solidworks I was able to design the organic shapes that made up the space shuttle's wings and body, and then by using Masercam I created three-axis CNC toolpaths to cut the part out of a aolid block of metal. With a feed time constraint of only 1 hour and 30 minutes I optimized these toolpaths to have the maximum possible tool size and thus maximum feed rates to ensure good surface finish, at the maximum possible speed.
