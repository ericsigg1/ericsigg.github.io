I developed a winch system capable of raising and lowering a sensor suite mounted to an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV). This ASV was then deployed in the Schuylkill river near UPenn's campus. Using autonomous navigation a team of graduate students and I were able to gain high density 3D data (in depth, and position on the surface the river) on river bathymetry, pH, temperature, salinity, and turbidity.
